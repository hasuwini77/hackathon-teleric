# 🚀 Project Roadmap Summary

This document synthesizes the recent feedback from clients (Katarina, Teemu) into a clear comparison of our current solution versus the target for the next iteration.

## 📊 Current State vs. Future Vision

### WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE:
- **Foundational SKYE Agent**: A working chat interface with a Python backend and 3D avatar.
- **Enterprise Signal Chain (Demo)**: A mock system that "pre-fills" user data (role, skills, goals) so the agent "knows" who you are.
- **Base Learning Paths**: Simple extraction of skills and initial course suggestions.
- **Modern Infrastructure**: Next.js 15, Tailwind v4, and database persistence (Neon).

### WHAT DO WE NEED:
- **Dedicated Hardware Scenarios**: Building the specific "Developer to ASIC/FPGA" re-skilling path for Katarina.
- **SKYE Knowledge Harvester**: Automating the "vacuum cleaning" of the internet for high-quality, free videos and docs.
- **Time-Commitment Logic**: Allowing users to set 25% to 100% time allowance and seeing the timeline to "Beginner Productivity" adjust instantly.
- **Internal System Bridges**: Moving from "Mock Data" to real API connections with internal Company Knowledge and HR platforms.
- **Active Progress Checks**: Self-test exercises to verify learning and skip content the user already knows.

| Feature | CURRENTLY HAVE | SKYE TARGET |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Profiles** | Basic info (Role/Skills) | **Real Scenarios**: Re-skilling path (Web to Hardware). |
| **Smart Connections** | Manual mock data | **Live Links**: Auto-connect to internal wikis/HR. |
| **Content Discovery** | Basic lists | **SKYE**: Smart search for free web guides. |
| **Timing** | Simple flow | **Custom Schedule**: 1 day vs 5 days per week. |
| **Progress Checks** | Text-based extraction | **Quick Tests**: Prove you've learned to trim the path. |

## 🎯 Key Differentiators
As Daniel noted, traditional learning platforms have strict "Zero AI" policies. Our tool fills this gap by:
1. **Empowering Employees**: Allowing the use of AI to enhance learning and application.
2. **Contextual Learning**: Bridging the gap between external resources and internal company procedures.
3. **Speed to Action**: Providing the fastest path from learning to application in a specific role.
