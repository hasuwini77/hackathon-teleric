These guidelines define how the AI should **improve visual design, layout, and overall feel** of the product **without changing core functionality, information architecture, or user flows**. Treat this as a design-refinement brief, not a product rewrite.

---

## 1. Design Goals

* Preserve existing structure, copy, and navigation logic
* Elevate perceived quality, clarity, and focus
* Maintain a calm, premium, learning-first aesthetic
* Reduce cognitive load while increasing visual hierarchy
* Feel modern, technical, and trustworthy (career/learning platform)

---

## 2. Overall Look & Feel

**Mood**

* Dark, atmospheric, and focused
* Subtle gradients and depth over flat surfaces
* Calm confidence, not playful or loud

**Inspiration keywords**

* "Guided journey"
* "Professional cockpit"
* "Quietly powerful"

---

## 3. Color & Contrast

* Base: deep navy / charcoal backgrounds
* Accent: soft purple / indigo for progress, CTAs, highlights
* Text hierarchy:

  * Primary: high-contrast off-white
  * Secondary: muted gray-blue
  * Tertiary/meta: low-contrast cool gray

Guidelines:

* Never rely on color alone to convey state (use icons, labels)
* Gradients should be subtle and slow (top-left → bottom-right)
* Avoid pure black or pure white

---

## 4. Typography

**Hierarchy is critical**

* Page titles: large, airy, confident
* Section headers: clearly separated with spacing, not lines
* Body text: compact but readable
* Meta text (durations, progress, labels): smaller + muted

Rules:

* Use weight and size more than color to signal importance
* Avoid overusing uppercase
* Let text breathe — increase line-height slightly

---

## 5. Layout & Spacing

* Prefer vertical rhythm over dense stacking
* Use generous padding inside cards
* Separate sections with space, not dividers

**Alignment**

* Strong left alignment for content-heavy areas
* Center alignment only for onboarding / hero moments

**Scanning behavior**

* Assume users skim first, read second
* Key information should be visible without interaction

---

## 6. Cards & Containers

Cards are the primary UI building block.

Card design principles:

* Soft radius (consistent across app)
* Subtle elevation via shadow or gradient edge
* Clear internal hierarchy (title → description → meta → action)

Avoid:

* Hard borders
* Heavy outlines
* Overlapping cards unless intentionally layered

---

## 7. Progress & Status Indicators

Progress should feel motivating, not overwhelming.

* Progress bars: smooth, rounded, animated subtly
* Percentages should be readable at a glance
* Status labels (e.g., Not Started, In Progress):

  * Muted pills
  * Calm language
  * Never alarming colors

---

## 8. CTAs & Interaction

Primary actions:

* Visually distinct but not loud
* Rounded, solid, confident

Secondary actions:

* Lower contrast
* Outline or soft fill

Rules:

* One primary CTA per view
* Actions should feel intentional, not cluttered

---

## 9. Learning Journey Views

* Reinforce the idea of a **path**, not a list
* Visually show sequence and momentum
* Current focus should stand out clearly

Encourage:

* "This week’s focus" or "Next up" patterns
* Gentle guidance over choice overload

---

## 10. Course / Module Detail Pages

* Clear entry point (title, duration, status)
* One obvious next action
* Resources should be scannable:

  * Icon → title → format → time

Avoid:

* Long unbroken lists
* Equal visual weight for all resources

---

## 11. Micro‑Interactions & Motion

* Motion should feel supportive, not decorative
* Use for:

  * Progress updates
  * State changes
  * Hover / focus clarity

Guidelines:

* Short, smooth easing
* No bouncing or playful effects
* Animation should never block progress

---

## 12. Accessibility & Clarity

* Maintain sufficient contrast in dark mode
* Text should remain readable at smaller sizes
* Click targets must feel generous

Clarity > cleverness at all times.

---

## 13. What NOT to Change

* Core user flow
* Feature set
* Learning structure
* Terminology
* Navigation logic

This document is about **refinement, not reinvention**.

---

## 14. Success Criteria

A successful design pass should feel:

* Cleaner
* More focused
* Easier to navigate
* More premium
* Less mentally taxing

If something looks simpler but feels more powerful, it’s working.
